Taking a look into a slice of time in crypto world 

Here is a look into historical crypto data from 08-30-2019. This is the most current data I could retrieve for free. The date of this data has no significant meaning. While I am not particularly interested in cryptocurrencies, I felt this project was good practice for quering data, as well as working with an online API to retrieve specific data. 

The data was retrieved from CoinMarketCap's API. CoinMarketCap is a highly referenced crypto-asset tracking website commonly cited by CNBC, Bloomberg, and crypto enthausists across the world. The CoinMarketCap API does require an API key, which can be obtained by signing up for a free account from their website here: https://coinmarketcap.com/api/. Please refer to the importing_crypto.py file for step by step insturction on obtaining the requested data.

# lets get into the data:
The first table below shows the prices of the top 10 most expensive coins. Funny enough Bitcoin's price at 9,558.551637 is right around where it stands today (06-2-2020) at a current price of 9,522.45. 

Graphing the change in price over time could be a good update to make in a future version.

1. Bitcoin: 9558.551637
2. Maker: 471.141888
3. Bitcoin Cash: 281.029003
4. Ethereum: 168.688634
5. Bitcoin SV: 128.391324
6. Dash: 81.019993 
7. Monero: 67.641131 
8. Litecoin: 64.349090 
9. Zcash: 44.863475 
10. Decred: 22.798488 

Bitcoins price is much much higher than all the other 100 crypto coins research. Does their market cap represent a similar finding?

Looking into # Figure_1 you can see this is definitely the case. 

On 08-30-2019 Bitcoin's market cap was 76.5% of all 100 crypto coins. The second largest coin Ethereum, which totalled a whopping 7.6%. In other words, Bitcoin is by far the largest coin.
