Taking a look into a slice of time in crypto world 

Here is a look into historical crypto data from 08-30-2019. This is the most current data I could retrieve for free. The date of this data has no significant meaning. While I am not particularly interested in cryptocurrencies, I felt this project was good practice for quering data, as well as working with an online API to retrieve specific data. 

The data was retrieved from CoinMarketCap's API. CoinMarketCap is a highly referenced crypto-asset tracking website commonly cited by CNBC, Bloomberg, and crypto enthausists across the world. The CoinMarketCap API does require an API key, which can be obtained by signing up for a free account from their website here: https://coinmarketcap.com/api/. Please refer to the importing_crypto.py file for step by step insturction on obtaining the requested data.

# lets get into the data:
The first table below shows the prices of the top 10 most expensive coins. Funny enough Bitcoin's price at 9,558.551637 is right around where it stands today (06-2-2020) at a current price of 9,522.45. 

Graphing the change in price over time could be a good update to make in a future version.

1. Bitcoin: 9558.551637
2. Maker: 471.141888
3. Bitcoin Cash: 281.029003
4. Ethereum: 168.688634
5. Bitcoin SV: 128.391324
6. Dash: 81.019993 
7. Monero: 67.641131 
8. Litecoin: 64.349090 
9. Zcash: 44.863475 
10. Decred: 22.798488 

Bitcoins price is much much higher than all the other 100 crypto coins research. Does their market cap represent a similar finding?

Looking into Figure_1 you can see this is definitely the case. 

On 08-30-2019 Bitcoin's market cap was 76.5% of all 100 crypto coins. The second largest coin Ethereum, which totalled a whopping 7.6%. In other words, Bitcoin is by far the largest coin and controls a massive amount of market cap.

What other characteristics are crypto coins known for? Volatility. With some data on how volatile the coins were at that point in time, this was possible to represent in a graph. Figure_2 shows the top 10 coins with the largest price % changes in the last 24 hours.

The graph on the left reveals some shocking statistics. The coin Wanchain, shot up over 21% in the prior 24 hours. Aurora also did pretty well that day raising almost 17% in 24 hours. On the flip side, the biggest loser on 08-30-2019 was a coin called ICON that lost -3.88%. Coin BitShares took second biggest loser, erasing -3.81% of its value. Is betting on random coins a viable investment tactic? It may seem to be if the largest single day difference between the biggest winner Wanchain and the biggest loser ICON is ~17%...
